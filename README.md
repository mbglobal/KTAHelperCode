# KTAHelperCode
Helper code for KTA development.  Use to review hidden Form/Session/Text values at run time.
Show Form, Session and Textbox values in pop up Alerts message boxes without having to break into Developer mode.
Add function calls to a JavaScript Action and add implementation code to form's JavaScript Functions to view hidden form/session values at runtime.
Link JS action to some event like a button click, to allow an admin to trigger showing runtime values on demand.
